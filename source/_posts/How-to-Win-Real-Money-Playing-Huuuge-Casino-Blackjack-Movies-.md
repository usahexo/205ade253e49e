#  How to Play and Win at Huuuge Casino Blackjack Movies 

In Huuuge Casino, blackjack is one of the table games in which you can use your free chips to play. To increase your chances of winning, below are some tips that you can follow:

1st Rule: Don’t Bust

When you have more than 10 in your hand, it is always important to remember not to bust. This means that you should not draw anymore cards if your total sum would go over 21. The aim of the game is to get closer to 21 without going over, and if you bust then you automatically lose regardless of the dealer’s cards.

2nd Rule: Split Aces and Eights

If you are dealt two aces or two eights, then it is usually a good idea to split them up into two separate hands. This will give you more chances of winning since each hand will have its own individual chance at getting closer to 21. Just be sure to keep track of what each card is worth when splitting, as well as when doubling down.

3rd Rule: Double Down With A Good Hand

If you have a hand with a value of 9, 10, or 11, then it is usually a good idea to double down. This means that you will be placing an extra bet equal to your original bet, and in return you receive just one more card. This can be a risky move but it can also lead to big rewards if successful.
