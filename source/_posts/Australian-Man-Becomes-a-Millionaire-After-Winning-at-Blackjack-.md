Australia's most successful blackjack player, who goes by the name of "Thomas", has won more than $3M from playing the game in casinos around the country.

Thomas started playing blackjack when he was in his early 20s, and has since developed an unbeatable strategy that has resulted in him winning more money than any other player in Australia.
