#  Casino Plans Moves Forward as Local Officials Approve 

On Tuesday, May 7th, 2019, casino officials announced that their plans for a new facility were moving forward after local officials approved the development. The $1.5 billion project is set to include a casino, hotel, and entertainment complex. 

The plans had been met with some resistance from locals in the past, but officials believe that the new complex will create thousands of jobs and bring in millions of dollars in revenue to the area. It is scheduled to open in late 2022. 

Casino expansion has been a hot topic in recent years as more and more states legalize gambling. This is the latest development in that trend, as officials seem to be recognizing the potential benefits that casinos can bring to a community.

"This new facility will create hundreds of jobs and bring economic development to Norman," said Governor Kevin Stitt. "It will also generate new tourism revenue for the state."
