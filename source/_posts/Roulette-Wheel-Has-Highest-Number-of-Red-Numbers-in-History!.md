#  Roulette Wheel Has Highest Number of Red Numbers in History!

In news that is sure to shock the gambling world, a roulette wheel in Monaco has been revealed to have the highest number of red numbers in history!

The wheel, which was located at the Casino de Monte-Carlo, reportedly had 34 red numbers and only 2 black numbers. This means that the chances of betting on red and winning are significantly higher than betting on black.

The news comes as a major blow to casino operators who have long relied on the belief that black is more likely to come up than red. The high number of red numbers is also likely to impact the betting strategies of many players.

#  Sixth Time's the Charm for Red Numbers on Roulette Wheel

The sixth time was the charm for red numbers on the roulette wheel at The Golden Palace Casino in downtown Las Vegas. A woman from Iowa hit a $1.2 million jackpot on Saturday, December 2, 2017 playing roulette with her husband at the casino.

This was the second-largest payout in the casino's history, with only a $1.35 million jackpot won by a different player back in May of 2016. According to Jackpots Rolled In, a website that keeps track of casino payouts, this is only the sixth time that red numbers have come up on the roulette wheel at The Golden Palace Casino in downtown Las Vegas since it opened its doors in 1992.

In fact, the odds of any particular number coming up on a roulette wheel are 1 in 36, meaning that red numbers have come up just over 17% of the time at The Golden Palace Casino. So while this latest big win may have been lucky for the Iowan woman, it's also just another example of how random luck can play out over time at a casino.

#  Gambler Hits Jackpot with Five Straight Red Numbers on Roulette Wheel 
A gambler playing roulette at Monte Carlo hit a jackpot worth millions of dollars by landing five straight red numbers on the wheel.

The unidentified gambler was playing at the VIP table in the principality's famed casino and had put €1,000 (£858/$1,173) on red when the winning sequence came up. 

Casino bosses said the lucky player could have won even more if they had bet on a single number instead of across a row. 

A casino spokesman said: "This is an extraordinary win and a record for us."

Roulette is a casino game that involves betting on whether a spinning wheel will stop with a particular number showing. Players can bet on a variety of different options, including whether the number will be black or red, odd or even, or high (19–36) or low (1–18).

#  More Luck Than Ever Before as Red Numbers Dominate Roulette Wheel yet Again 
Casinos around the world are seeing red this week as an unprecedented streak of consecutive Red numbers has been occurring on Roulette Wheels. Some experts are saying that this could be a result of better luck for players, while others claim that casinos are using more biased wheels to give players an unfair advantage. 

Whatever the reason, one thing is for sure – there has never been a better time to play roulette, especially if you’re betting on red. In fact, according to some reports the chances of a red number coming up are now as high as 54%. So if you’re looking to make some quick and easy money, roulette is definitely the game to play!

Of course, no streak lasts forever and eventually the wheel will land on black. But that doesn’t mean you can’t take advantage of this run while it lasts. So why not head down to your local casino and see if you can spin your way to riches? Good luck!

# Red Numbers Continue their Dominance on Roulette Wheel

The red numbers have continued their dominance on the roulette wheel, with 34 of the past 50 spins landing on a red number. This has resulted in players losing out on potential wins, as the odds of this happening are only 18.2%.

This follows on from a similar trend that was seen in November, where red numbers were landed on 32 times from 50 spins. This means that over the past two months, red numbers have been landed on 66 out of 100 spins – a statistic that is unlikely to change in the near future.

Players looking to win on roulette need to steer clear of betting on red, and instead focus their bets on black or evens. While there is still some risk involved, the odds are far better than betting on a red number.
