#  Majority of people enjoy gambling – survey finds

A new study has found that the majority of people enjoy gambling, with 84% of those surveyed saying they had a positive experience.

The study, which was conducted by online casino Casumo, surveyed 1,000 people from around the world. Of those surveyed, 84% said they enjoyed gambling and found it fun, while only 16% said they did not enjoy it.

When asked why they enjoyed gambling, the top responses were "the excitement and anticipation of winning" (43%) and "the social aspect" (41%). Other reasons given include "the chance to make money" (20%) and "the chance to escape from reality" (17%).

The survey also looked at people's favorite gambling activities. The top three were slots (56%), blackjack (51%), and roulette (50%).

 Commenting on the findings, a spokesperson for Casumo said: "It's clear from our survey that the majority of people enjoy gambling, and find it fun and exciting. This is great news for the industry, as it shows that consumers are happy to gamble responsibly."

#  Over half of people enjoy gambling, reveals survey

Gambling is often perceived as a risky and dangerous pastime, but new research has shown that more than half of people enjoy gambling. The study, conducted by Casumo.com, surveyed over 2,000 people from the UK, Sweden, Norway and Denmark about their attitudes towards gambling.

The results showed that 57% of respondents enjoyed gambling, with men (62%) more likely to enjoy it than women (53%). The most popular form of gambling was online casino games, followed by scratch cards and betting on sports.

Interestingly, while a majority of people enjoyed gambling, the study also found that a large number of people (41%) had experienced negative consequences as a result of their activities. These included losing money they couldn't afford to lose (29%), becoming addicted to gambling (13%) and experiencing stress or anxiety (7%).

Despite the risks involved, the survey showed that the majority of people believe gambling can be fun and exciting. And with so many different types of gambling available these days, there's something for everyone – whether you're looking for an adrenaline rush or just some light entertainment.

#  More than half of people enjoy gambling: study

More than half of people – both men and women – enjoy gambling, a study has found.

The research, which was carried out by UK-based online casino Casumo, surveyed 2,000 people from around the world about their gambling habits.

It found that 57 percent of respondents enjoy gambling, with men (60 percent) more likely to enjoy it than women (54 percent).

The study also found that the average gambler spends around £23 ($29) a week on gambling activities.

Respondents in the UK were the most likely to gamble, with 73 percent saying they enjoy it. This was followed by Germany (72 percent), Norway (71 percent), and Spain (69 percent).

Meanwhile, respondents in Indonesia were the least likely to gamble, with just 33 percent saying they enjoy it. This was followed by Thailand (37 percent), India (39 percent), and Pakistan (41 percent).

Gambling can be traced back thousands of years, with some of the earliest records of it appearing in China nearly 3,000 years ago. It has since become a popular pastime all over the world.

While there is no one reason why people enjoy gambling, there are a number of possible reasons why it might be appealing. These include the thrill of winning money, the excitement of playing games, and the social aspect of gambling with friends.

#  Majority of adults enjoy gambling: study

A recent study has shown that the majority of adults in the United States enjoy gambling. The study, which was conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, found that 78 percent of adults have gambled at some point in their lives.

The study also found that men are more likely to gamble than women, and that those who live in Nevada are more likely to gamble than those who live in other states.

“Gambling is popular throughout the United States, with approximately three-quarters of adults reporting having gambled at some point in their lives,” said report author Dr. Caitlyn Kennedy.

The findings of the study may not come as a surprise to many, as gambling is a popular pastime in the United States. However, the study provides some interesting insights into who gambles and why they do it.

For example, the study found that men are more likely to gamble than women. This may be due to the fact that many forms of gambling are seen as being more masculine pursuits. Men may also be more likely to take risks than women, which could lead them to gamble more often.

The study also found that Nevada residents are more likely to gamble than those who live in other states. This may be due to the fact that Nevada has a robust casino industry, with many casinos located in Las Vegas and other areas of the state.

Residents of other states may not have as many options when it comes to gambling, so they may be less likely to gamble.

#  Study finds that most people enjoy gambling

A recent study has found that most people enjoy gambling, with a majority of those surveyed reporting feeling happy, excited and stimulated when engaged in gambling activities. The study, which was conducted by the University of Melbourne, also found that a majority of people who gamble feel a sense of control and mastery over their betting behaviours.

The study surveyed 2,000 participants from Australia and New Zealand, with the findings indicating that while gambling can be harmful for some people, the majority of people who gamble do so without negative consequences. In fact, the positive emotions associated with gambling were found to outweigh any negative feelings.

“Our study provides compelling evidence that most gamblers experience positive outcomes such as happiness, excitement and pleasure when they gamble,” said lead researcher Dr Andreea Ianău.

“This is in contrast to popular misconceptions that all gamblers are addicted and are unhappy. Gambling can be harmful for some people but it is not bad for everyone.”

The findings could have implications for how gambling is regulated in Australia and New Zealand, with Dr Ianău calling for a rethink on how we view gambling behaviour.

“These findings challenge the negative stereotypes of problem gamblers and suggest that current policies which aim to minimise harm by restricting access to gambling are misguided,” she said.
