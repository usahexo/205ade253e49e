# How do you earn Energy Stars?

A Bradley Beach home earned Energy Star certification.

The homeowner, Stacey Kaledin, said she was "extremely excited" to earn the rating.

To earn the Energy Star certification, a home must meet strict energy efficiency guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Kaledin's home achieved a score of 90 out of 100 on the EPA's Home Energy Scorecard.

The Home Energy Scorecard is a tool that measures how efficient a home is in 10 categories, including heating and cooling systems, insulation, and water heating.

A higher score means a more efficient home.

Kaledin did not have to make any major upgrades to her home to achieve the certification.
"It just took some tweaking of our habits," she said.

Some simple tips for increasing your home's energy efficiency include installing LED light bulbs, sealing leaks around doors and windows, and programming your thermostat to automatically adjust during peak hours.

You can also save money on your energy bill by using a programmable thermostat to schedule times when your family is not at home or asleep.

# What can you do with Energy Stars?

Home appliances account for a large amount of energy consumption in the United States. In fact, home appliances use about 20% of the electricity produced in the country. That’s why it’s important to make sure you are using appliances that have earned the Energy Star label.

What is an Energy Star? An Energy Star is a designation given to home appliances that meet or exceed energy efficiency guidelines set by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). To earn the Energy Star label, an appliance must be at least 15% more efficient than the minimum federal standard.

But what can you do with an Energy Star appliance? Here are just a few things:

-Use less energy and save money on your utility bills

-Reduce your environmental impact

-Make your home more comfortable

Let’s take a closer look at each of these benefits.

First, using less energy means saving money on your utility bills. Appliances that have earned the Energy Star designation use anywhere from 10% to 50% less energy than standard models. For example, if you replace an old air conditioner with a new Energy Star model, you could save up to $200 per year on cooling costs! Not only will you save money on your monthly bills, but you’ll also be helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
