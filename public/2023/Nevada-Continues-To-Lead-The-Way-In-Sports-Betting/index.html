        <h1 id="Nevada-Continues-To-Lead-The-Way-In-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Nevada-Continues-To-Lead-The-Way-In-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Continues To Lead The Way In Sports Betting"></a>Nevada Continues To Lead The Way In Sports Betting</h1><p>Nevada sportsbooks took in $559 million in legal bets last year, according to a new report from the Nevada Gaming Control Board. That was the second consecutive year that wagers placed in the state exceeded $500 million and it’s also the eighth time in the last 10 years that Nevada has led the nation in sports betting.</p>
<p>The volume of bets placed in Nevada is even more impressive when you consider that it’s a relatively small state with a population of just over 2.8 million. In comparison, New Jersey – which has recently legalized sports betting following a Supreme Court ruling – has a population of nearly 9 million people.</p>
<p>Most of Nevada’s sports betting action comes from the Las Vegas strip, where casinos such as Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, and Wynn Las Vegas all have large race and sports books. The casinos make most of their profits from gambling on games like blackjack and craps, but the sports books are an important source of revenue as well.</p>
<p>2018 was a good year for Nevada casinos overall, with total winnings coming in at just over $26 billion. That represents an increase of 4.5% from 2017 and it’s the sixth consecutive year that casino revenues have increased in the state.</p>
<p>Online gambling is also growing rapidly in Nevada, with operators such as Golden Nugget and bet365 taking bets from residents of the Silver State. In fact, online gambling accounted for approximately 15% of all casino revenues in Nevada last year.</p>
<p>While other states are likely to legalize sports betting in the coming years, Nevada will continue to be a leader in this industry. The combination of strong tourism sector and liberal gambling laws has made Las Vegas one of the most popular destinations in the world, and there is no sign that this trend will slowdown anytime soon.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Sports-Betting-Legislation-Goes-Into-Effect"><a href="#Delaware-Sports-Betting-Legislation-Goes-Into-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Sports Betting Legislation Goes Into Effect"></a>Delaware Sports Betting Legislation Goes Into Effect</h1><p>The state of Delaware has always been at the forefront of gambling legislation and on June 5, 2018, their sports betting legislation went into effect.</p>
<p>This bill allows for both in-person and online sports betting within state lines. Delaware was one of the first states to legalize casino gambling in 1976 and, since then, they have been looking for new ways to bring in revenue.</p>
<p>Now that sports betting is legal, residents can place bets on a variety of sporting events at the three casino resorts located in the state. The lottery commission also offers an online platform for residents to bet on games.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on what types of bets can be placed. For instance, Prop Bets (such as whether Team A will score more points than Team B) are not allowed. However, bets on who will win or lose a game are allowed.</p>
<p>So far, the response to sports betting has been positive. The casinos are seeing an increase in foot traffic and the lottery commission reports that there has been an increase in online registrations. In addition, the state is expecting to bring in an additional $3 million in revenue this fiscal year from sports betting taxes.</p>
<p>Residents seem to be enjoying the convenience of being able to place a bet online as well as the social aspect of going to a casino to place a bet in person. With all of these benefits, it is no wonder that more states are looking into legalizing sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Bill-Would-Allow-Remote-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Bill-Would-Allow-Remote-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Bill Would Allow Remote Sports Betting"></a>Pennsylvania Bill Would Allow Remote Sports Betting</h1><p>A bill under consideration in the Pennsylvania legislature would legalize remote sports betting, a move that could generate millions of dollars in new revenue for the state.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation, House Bill 984, was introduced last week by Rep. Robert Rita, a Democrat from south suburban Chicago. The bill would allow sports betting operators to establish up to five physical locations and five remote locations in the state.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is one of several states considering bills to legalize sports betting in the wake of the US Supreme Court’s decision last month to strike down a federal ban on the practice. Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia have already moved to legalize sports betting, and several other states are expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board (PGCB) estimates that legalizing sports betting could generate as much as $100 million in new revenue for the state each year. Much of that money would go toward funding education and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>“This is something that has been overdue for a long time,” Rita said in a statement. “It’s time to bring this activity out of the shadows and into the sunlight where it can be properly regulated and taxed.”</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting worry that it could lead to increased gambling addiction and other social problems. But supporters say that such concerns can be addressed through proper regulation.</p>
<h1 id="West-Virginia-Legalizes-Sports-Betting"><a href="#West-Virginia-Legalizes-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="West Virginia Legalizes Sports Betting"></a>West Virginia Legalizes Sports Betting</h1><p>West Virginia became the latest state to legalize sports betting on Monday, joining Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The state’s new law allows for both in-person and online sports betting at approved casinos and racetracks. Bettors will be able to place wagers on professional and collegiate sporting events, as well as worldwide horse races.</p>
<p>“This is a great day for the State of West Virginia,” said Governor Jim Justice. “We’re going to create jobs and bring in new economic development with this legislation.”</p>
<p>Justice has previously estimated that the new law could generate $5 million in revenue for the state each year.</p>
<p>Other states that have passed legislation to legalize sports betting this year include Rhode Island, New York, and Connecticut.</p>
<h1 id="More-States-Eye-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#More-States-Eye-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="More States Eye Legalized Sports Betting"></a>More States Eye Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>As the US Supreme Court ponders a case that could legalize sports betting nationwide, more states are moving to legalize the practice in case the court rules in their favor.</p>
<p>Arkansas, Delaware, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia have all either introduced or passed legislation this year that would legalize some form of sports betting.</p>
<p>This follows decisions by Colorado, Illinois and Rhode Island to legalize sports betting last year.</p>
<p>The flurry of legislative activity comes as the US Supreme Court is mulling a case that could overturn a federal law prohibiting most states from legalizing sports betting.</p>
<p>The case, Christie v. NCAA, revolves around a 2012 New Jersey law that would have allowed sports betting at casinos and racetracks. The NCAA and professional sports leagues sued to stop the law, arguing that it violated a federal ban on state-sponsored sports gambling.</p>
<p>In 2017, the US Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of the NCAA and professional sports leagues. The US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in June 2018.</p>
<p>If the court rules in New Jersey’s favor, it could open the door for other states to legalize sports betting. However, there is no guarantee that the court will rule in New Jersey’s favor.</p>
<p>At least one justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has expressed reservations about striking down the federal ban on state-sponsored sports gambling.</p>
<p>For now, states are moving ahead with legalization efforts in case the court does rule in their favor.</p>
